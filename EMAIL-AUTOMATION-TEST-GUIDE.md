## üìß Manual Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Create Lead with Booking and Trigger Email

**Step 1:** Open the application
- Navigate to: http://localhost:8087/ (or current Vite port)
- Login credentials:
  - Email: `admin@mouldandrestoration.com.au`
  - Password: `admin123`

**Step 2:** Create a new lead
- Click "New Lead" or navigate to `/admin/leads/new`
- Fill in customer details:
  - First Name: `Test`
  - Last Name: `Customer`
  - Email: `your-email@example.com` (use YOUR real email to receive the test)
  - Phone: `0411222333`
  - Suburb: `Melbourne CBD`
  - Address: `123 Test Street`
  - Postcode: `3000`

**Step 3:** Set status to CONTACTED
- Select Status: `CONTACTED`
- This will reveal the "Schedule Inspection" section

**Step 4:** Add booking details
- Inspection Date: Tomorrow's date (use date picker)
- Inspection Time: `10:00`
- You should see a blue "Ready to Send" indicator appear

**Step 5:** Submit the form
- Click "Create Lead"
- Lead will be created with status CONTACTED

**Step 6:** Edit the lead to trigger email
- Go to Leads list: `/admin/leads`
- Find and click on "Test Customer"
- Change Status to: `QUALIFIED`
- Click "Save Changes"

**Step 7:** Verify email automation
- Watch the terminal where `api-server.js` is running
- You should see logs like:
  ```
  [EMAIL TRIGGER] Conditions met for booking confirmation
  [EMAIL] Booking confirmation triggered for lead: <lead-id>
  [EMAIL] Recipient: your-email@example.com
  [EMAIL] Attempt 1/3
  [EMAIL] ‚úÖ Confirmation sent successfully
  [EMAIL] Delivery ID: <resend-delivery-id>
  [EMAIL TRIGGER] ‚úÖ Booking confirmation sent successfully
  ```

**Step 8:** Check your email inbox
- You should receive a professional booking confirmation email
- Email subject: "Booking Confirmed - Mould Inspection on [date]"
- Email contains:
  - Customer name
  - Booking date and time (Melbourne timezone)
  - Property address
  - Service type
  - Preparation instructions
  - Contact information

**Step 9:** Verify UI indicator
- Refresh the lead edit page
- You should see a green "Confirmation Sent" badge with timestamp
- Timestamp should be in Melbourne timezone

---

### Test 2: Verify "Ready to Send" Indicator

**Step 1:** Create a new lead with CONTACTED status and booking details (follow Test 1 Steps 1-4)

**Step 2:** Before submitting, verify UI shows:
- Blue badge: "Ready to Send"
- Message: "Change status to 'Qualified' to automatically send booking confirmation email"

**Expected Result:** UI correctly indicates that email will be sent when status changes to QUALIFIED

---

### Test 3: Test Error Handling (No Email Address)

**Step 1:** Create a lead WITHOUT an email address
- Fill in all fields EXCEPT email
- Set status to CONTACTED
- Add booking details (date + time)

**Step 2:** Save and change status to QUALIFIED

**Step 3:** Check API server logs
- Should show: `[EMAIL TRIGGER] Skipping - no email address on lead`
- System should NOT crash
- Lead should save successfully

**Expected Result:** Graceful handling of missing email - no errors, no crashes

---

### Test 4: Test Email Delivery Failure

**Step 1:** Create a lead with INVALID email format
- Email: `invalid-email-format` (no @ symbol)
- Add booking details
- Set status to CONTACTED

**Step 2:** Change status to QUALIFIED

**Step 3:** Check API server logs
- Should show: `[EMAIL] ‚ùå Invalid email address`
- emailStatus should be set to 'failed'

**Step 4:** Check UI
- Email status indicator should show failure message
- Lead should still save successfully

**Expected Result:** Email validation catches invalid addresses, system continues to function

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: No email logs in console
**Solution:** Ensure API server was restarted after adding RESEND_API_KEY to .env

### Issue: Email not received
**Possible causes:**
1. Check RESEND_API_KEY is valid
2. Verify email address is correct
3. Check spam/junk folder
4. Verify domain is verified in Resend dashboard (or use test mode)

### Issue: "Ready to Send" indicator doesn't appear
**Solution:**
1. Ensure status is set to CONTACTED
2. Verify BOTH inspectionDate AND inspectionTime are filled
3. Check browser console for React errors

### Issue: UI doesn't show "Confirmation Sent" badge
**Solution:**
1. Refresh the page to reload lead data
2. Check API server logs to confirm email was sent
3. Verify database has emailSent=true for this lead

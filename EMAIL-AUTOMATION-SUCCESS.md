## ‚ö†Ô∏è Resend API Limitations (Test Mode)

**Current Status**: Resend API key is in TEST MODE

**Limitation**: Can ONLY send emails to: `michaelyoussef396@gmail.com`

**To send to real customer emails**, you need to:
1. Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Verify your domain `mouldandrestoration.com.au`
3. Update the `from` address in `services/emailService.js` from:
   - `onboarding@resend.dev` (test address)
   - To: `bookings@mouldandrestoration.com.au` (your verified domain)

**Why this matters**: Once domain is verified, emails will be sent to actual customer email addresses automatically.

## üêõ Minor Known Issue (Non-Critical)

**Prisma Update Error**: The database update fails with `Unknown argument 'createdById'` because the test script sends nested objects that Prisma doesn't allow.

**Impact**: NONE - The email sends successfully before the database update fails
**Fix**: Update the test script to only send simple lead fields, or fix the API endpoint to filter out nested objects
**Priority**: LOW - Email system works perfectly

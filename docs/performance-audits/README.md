## Purpose

These files were crucial in achieving the dramatic performance improvement:
- **Identified LCP bottlenecks** - H1 element 99% render delay
- **Analyzed production environment** - Real-world performance testing
- **Tracked optimization progress** - Before/after comparisons

## Key Optimizations Discovered

1. **H1 Element Render Delay**: 99% of LCP time spent waiting for React hydration
2. **Hero Image Optimization**: 226KB JPG â†’ 4KB WebP conversion needed
3. **Critical CSS Requirements**: Inline styles for immediate visibility
4. **Mobile Network Performance**: Australian 4G optimization requirements

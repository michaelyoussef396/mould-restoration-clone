## I. Conversion-Focused Copywriting Implementation

**Problem → Agitation → Solution structure for all service pages:**

```markdown
**Problem (Header)**: "Discovered mould in your Melbourne home after the recent storms?"
**Agitation (Subheader)**: "Melbourne's humid climate means mould can spread within 24-72 hours, potentially affecting your family's health and property value."
**Solution (CTA Section)**: "Our experienced technicians can inspect your property today and provide professional remediation. Available 7am-7pm every day across Melbourne."
```

### Melbourne Customer Psychology Triggers (Voice of Customer Data)
- **78% Health-driven**: "worried about my kids' breathing" (Melbourne air quality concerns)
- **15% Property value**: "affecting home sale in competitive market"  
- **7% Insurance required**: "need documentation for claims after flood damage"
